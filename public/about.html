<h1>About Me</h1>
<h4>Name: Himabindu Jami</h4>
 <p> Over 10 years! That's how long I've been playing around with art!</p>
  
  <p>I myself to be pretty easygoing, cheerful and nice to everyone. I like my classes to be really chill and casual, though if you're feeling adventurous I can give you a hell of a challenge if that's what you're looking for! I'm extremely honest and I will gladly let you know my opinion on things.</p>
  
  <p>I have 16 and 12 year old kids - Snitika and Ishansri. </p>
  
  <p>The only thing that I ask is that, while chatting during class, let's please leave out politics and religion. I've got nothing against those topics, I just think that they stir trouble more often than not and I'd rather stay away from that possibility. I just want a nice environment where we can get along!
